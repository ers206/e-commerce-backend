# e-commerce-backend
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database



Fill out the unfinished routes in product-routes.js, tag-routes.js, and category-routes.js to perform create, read, update, and delete operations using your Sequelize models.




Associations
You'll need to execute association methods on your Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them:

Product belongs to Category, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.

Category has many Product models.

Product belongs to many Tag models. Using the ProductTag through model, allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products.

Tag belongs to many Product models.
